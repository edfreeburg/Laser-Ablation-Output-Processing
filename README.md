Rev. 0.1a

# Purpose
This script was written to assist in the processing of LA-ICP-MS raw output as generated by Perkin Elmer ICP-MS instrumentation.

# Notes
This software is very ALPHA!  The main idea was to quickly do the same analyses repeatedly using a lot of hard coded variables.  In this case, a *.csv calibration file was generated using Cetac Technology's GEOPRO software and incorporated into this program.  Please be very aware that the program is simple in nature, but I believe powerful in repeatable use.  As I work on the program, I will commit changes.  Feel free to follow and suggest any functional changes/additions.
